# Mini Project: Object Oriented Programming in JS

## Overview
This project is aimed at practicing creating classes and methods in OOP. It is based on this [Techtonica requirement](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/blob/main/javascript/first-js-oop-project.md).

## Objectives
- Use the new JS object-oriented programming skills to create an "Event" class
- Write functions on the "Event" class that:
  - allows the event host to add tickets with prices and "ticket type" (e.g. regular, VIP, mezzanine, balcony, etc)
  - allows a user to input a price range they are willing to pay to see what ticket types are available to them
- Create a few event objects
- Push the event objects into an array and use jQuery to display the list of events to an html page.
